        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>If you're new to tofu, I recommend you start here.  I went from not really liking tofu that much to trying not to eat a pound of it at one sitting.  These are great hot or cold, as a snack or as part of a meal (try them on pasta!).  And it's easy!

            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp italian seasoning</li>
            <li>2 blocks extra firm tofu </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
