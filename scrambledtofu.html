        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p>Here's another extremely quick and easy tofu recipe.  Full or protein and great as part of a traditional breakfast instead of scrambled eggs, or to be added to breakfast burritos.  Great by itself, but even better if you sautee some vegetables before adding the tofu.</p>

            <li>2 tbsp nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black (kala namak) salt (or regular salt - the black salt give it an eggy taste)</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp turmeric</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp non-dairy milk (unsweetened)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions:</h2>
        <ol>
